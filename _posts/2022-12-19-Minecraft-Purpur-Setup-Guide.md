This guide should serve as a good basis to get a Minecraft Server for some friends. The only tools you need to get this working is Docker and Docker-Compose. Docker/Docker-Compose have versions for Mac, Windows, and Linux. I will be using Linux but the instructions should be pretty much the same.

# Install Docker and Docker-Compose
There is no reason for me to instruct how to do this. In a few months, my instructions could be out-dated. Follow the following links for instructions on how to install Docker on your OS:
* [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/#server). *note: you should install Docker Engine (server), not Docker Desktop*
* [Docker-Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/#scenario-two-install-the-compose-plugin)
