- ðŸ‘‹ About me: I am Jr Solutions Developer for Thornton's LLC. I got my Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science from Western Kentucky University. I have a wife that I love very much, no kids (yet), and no pets (yet). I have social media accounts but I really only check Discord and Reddit regularly.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning C#, WPF, and MVVM. I think I have a pretty good grasp of them at this point but I won't feel confident until I have a few more projects under my belt.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: trevorvance525@gmail.com I check it almost every day.
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: He/Him/His
- âš¡ Fun fact: I love self-hosting things and most of my git use is on my non-public [gitea](https://gitea.io/en-us/) instance.
